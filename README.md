<!-- ================= ABOUT SECTION ================= -->

## About Me
I am a data analyst with hands-on experience in analyzing business and operational data to uncover trends, evaluate performance, and support strategic decision-making. My work spans sales analytics, HR attrition analysis, and profitability reporting across multiple industries and geographies.

I specialize in transforming raw, unstructured data into meaningful insights through structured data modeling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and interactive dashboards using Excel, SQL, and Power BI. I am particularly passionate about building reports that not only look good but clearly communicate insights to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## What I Do
I collect, clean, and analyze datasets to answer business questions, identify performance gaps, and recommend data-driven actions. My workflow typically involves data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, and dashboard development to support informed decision-making.

Across my projects, I focus on:
- Sales and profitability analysis across time, products, and regions  
- Workforce and HR analytics, including attrition and employee behavior analysis  
- Building scalable data models and DAX measures for advanced reporting  
- Translating analytical findings into clear insights that support business growth and operational efficiency
